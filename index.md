### About

I'm Richard and I built this site to give people an outlet to seek and provide help during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Thousands of people, organizations, and informational sources are already directing assistance to specific impacted areas and individuals, so this site merely serves as a directory to consolidate them in a single location.

I hope this provides some measure of assistance to you, and I wish you all health and safety during this trying time.

â€”R

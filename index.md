*“All of us, at some time or other, need help. Whether we’re giving or receiving help, each one of us has something valuable to bring to this world.”* — Mr. Rogers

## Our Purpose

Crisis Community is a resource center, built in response to the Coronavirus Pandemic.

We’ve organized the site into the following sections:

* A section for [individuals who need help](/i-need-help-individuals/main/)
* A section for [organizations that need help](/i-need-help-organizations/main/) — *coming soon*
* A section for [opportunities to volunteer and provide help](/i-want-to-help/main/)

Our community of contributors have aggregated the relevant resources here (as many as we can find), so you can focus on what’s important to you.

When you discover a helpful outlet here, submit a suggestion, or recommend Crisis Community to your friends, you’re actively contributing to our mission.

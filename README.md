Hi there!

My name is Richard and I built Crisis Community to help compile all the relevant resources for people who need help or want to provide help.

This site is built with the help of Github Pages and Jekyll, and is currently running on the Edition theme.

Please feel free to send me feedback at richard@zrlee.com or fork this project if there's a similar problem you'd like to apply this solution to.

A few days into this project, and I managed to find a stock logo design I liked (the two hands representing a giver and a receiver). Downloaded the svg version so I could modify it slightly.

Decided to host a version of this site on [Cloud Cannon](https://cloudcannon.com/), which will serve as my testing site (while my production site will continue to live on github pages). It's built to handle Jekyll websites, and makes it significantly easier to create, edit, and see my changes instantly. I'll post more once I get a few hours into using it.

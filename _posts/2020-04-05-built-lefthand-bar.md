After spending the last few months consolidating all of the resources from news sources, reddit, recommendations from friends — I started grouping them into various categories. A few observations:

- Seems clear that I'll need to split "I need help" into separate organization and individual sections — very different needs, different resources.
- Will prioritize building "I need help" for individuals as this will have the most impact

Update on CloudCannon, which is the tool I'm using to handle site testing and iterations — still loving it. Does 90% of what I need it to do. I'm currently on their free version so this is more than enough. Some nice-to-haves I'd share as feedback:
- Allow me to modify my testing URL — this makes it easier for me to share, without worrying that I'd give someone permanent access to my testing

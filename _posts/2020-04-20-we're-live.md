After several weeks of development, Crisis Community is finally launched. The initial site has a:

* Home page
* Section for people in need, with 8 sub-topics covering:
    * Food assistance
    * Unemployment
    * Find a job
    * Healthcare
    * Education
    * Managing stress
    * Entertainment
* Section for people who want to help (with 4 sub-topics)
    * Medical supplies
    * Volunteering
    * Financial support
* Feedback form

Hoping this proves helpful. Plan is to be updating the site near-daily based on feedback.

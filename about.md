### About this site

This site was built for a simple purpose: in periods of crisis, show people (1) how to seek help and (2) how to provide help.

Covid-19 has tested us as countries, as communities, and as individuals. This site is dedicated to each of us, adapting and fighting this virus in our own way. Let's try to fight, and win it, together.
